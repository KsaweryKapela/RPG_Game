You walk through the dark tunel.
And walk.
And walk.
And waaaaaaaaaalk.
And then you walk some more.
Darkness gets really overwhelming.
You are slowly becoming more and more thirsty...
More and more hungry...
More and more tired...
...
You can clearly notice your strength slowly decreasing,
As it is getting harder to think.
